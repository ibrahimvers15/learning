-   **Multiple Subjects:** Covers Math, English, Computer, and General Science.
-   **Grade Levels:** Content tailored for grades 1 through 5.
-   **Interactive Quizzes:** Multiple-choice questionnaires to test understanding.
-   **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and kid-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   Git
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kids-learning-hub.git
    cd kids-learning-hub
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variable:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    -   Add your Gemini API key to this file:
        ```
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the URL provided) in your browser to see the app.

### **SECURITY WARNING**

**Do not expose your API key publicly.** The method used in this project (`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`) embeds the key in the built client-side code. This is **not secure** for a production application and is done here for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you should always handle API calls through a backend server or a secure cloud function that keeps your API key private.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This guide will help you deploy your site for free using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a new GitHub Repository:**
    -   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository. For this guide, we'll assume it's named `kids-learning-hub`.

2.  **Push your code to the repository:**
    -   Initialize Git and push your local project to the new repository.
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kids-learning-hub.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

3.  **Update `package.json`:**
    -   Open `package.json` and add a `homepage` field at the top. The URL should follow this format: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME/`.
    ```json
    {
      "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/kids-learning-hub/",
      "name": "kids-learning-hub",
      // ... rest of the file
    }
    ```

4.  **Update `vite.config.ts`:**
    - Open `vite.config.ts` and ensure the `base` property matches your repository name.
    ```typescript
    // ...
    export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
      // ...
      return {
        // ...
        base: "/kids-learning-hub/", // Must match your repository name
        // ...
      }
    })
    ```

5.  **Deploy the application:**
    -   Run the `deploy` script. This command will build your application and push the `dist` folder to a special `gh-pages` branch on your repository.
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

6.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    -   In your GitHub repository, go to `Settings` > `Pages`.
    -   Under `Build and deployment`, set the `Source` to `Deploy from a branch`.
    -   Set the `Branch` to `gh-pages` and the folder to `/ (root)`.
    -   Click `Save`.

Your website should be live at the `homepage` URL you specified in a few minutes!
